I. Comparison of Top-Level Containers
AspectAWTSwingMain WindowFrame: A heavyweight component representing the main window of an application.JFrame: A lightweight container representing a top-level window with decorations such as a title bar, border, and optional menu bar. It supports Swing components and features like pluggable look-and-feel and double buffering.Additional WindowWindow: A top-level container similar to Frame but without a title bar, border, or menu bar. Used for creating additional windows or dialogs.JDialog: Similar to AWT's Window but provides more features and flexibility, including support for Swing components and dialog-specific functionality like modal behavior.Web-based ApplicationApplet: A container for web applications. Runs in a browser or applet viewer with security restrictions.JApplet: The Swing equivalent of Applet, allowing the inclusion of Swing components in a web-based environment. It is lightweight.II.

Comparison of Event-Handling
AspectAWTSwingModelDelegation event model: Event handling is done by delegation. Components have corresponding listener interfaces (e.g., ActionListener, MouseListener).Listener model: Similar to AWT, Swing uses listener interfaces for event handling, providing a rich set of listeners for various events.Anonymous Inner ClassesCommonly used for implementing event listeners, which can make code more compact but may affect readability and maintainability for larger applications.Commonly used, but Swing also supports separate listener classes and lambda expressions (introduced in Java 8) for better readability and maintainability.ConcurrencyTypically uses a single event dispatch thread (EDT) to handle all UI events. Long-running tasks in the EDT can cause UI unresponsiveness.Ensures UI updates and event handling are performed on the EDT. Utilities like SwingUtilities.invokeLater() and SwingWorker help manage concurrency and prevent UI responsiveness issues.Custom EventsCustom event creation is less common.Allows creation of custom events and event listeners, useful for application-specific event handling.Look and FeelLimited customization options.Pluggable look-and-feel architecture allows customization of appearance and behavior independently of the platform, including event handling related to user interactions with GUI components.Summary
* Top-Level Containers: AWT uses heavyweight Frame and Window, while Swing uses lightweight JFrame and JDialog, which are more feature-rich and flexible.
* Component Class Names: AWT components have direct counterparts in Swing, typically prefixed with 'J' (e.g., Button vs. JButton).
* Event Handling: Both use a delegation event model, but Swing offers additional concurrency utilities and supports lambda expressions for better code management. Swing also allows custom events and has a pluggable look-and-feel system for extensive customization.
